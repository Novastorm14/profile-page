      <article><h3>About Me</h3>I was born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1999 and grew up traveling with my diplomat mother and artist father all over the world. First moving to Kuwait in 2003 where my sister was born. We were then posted to Prauge, Czech Republic, Washington D.C., U.S.A, Gabarone, Botswana, Pretoria, South Africa, and Nairobi, Kenya. I would go on to persue Studio Art at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, U.S.A. However, I was not happy with my major and I saw the pandemic as an oppertunity to change my career path. I decided to move back in with my parents who were in Rome, Italy at the time. While working and taking some online classes, I decided to persue my true passion, graphic design. My parents were assigned to Ottawa, Canada where I discovered Algonquin College and decided to apply. I am now an International graphic design student there and look forward to the new oppertunities ahead of me.</article>
